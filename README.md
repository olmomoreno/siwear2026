# 1st Workshop on Setup Interfaces for Wearable Robotics: Research Challenges and Industrial Perspectives
# Workshop abstract
Adopting emergent technologies has become important in the field of wearable robotics. The integration of novel applications could simplify the task, improve performance, and increase the level of satisfaction when users interact with such disruptive technologies.
These events should occur in a safe and reliable environment.
At this point, the research meets the challenges of human interaction in wearable robotics applications.
In this workshop, we will discuss the new trends and tendencies of human-interaction systems towards assistive technologies and devices, the benefits of human-robot interaction, how to better assess the user experience, and what research challenges are faced to create a positive impact on the industry.
The topics of interest in this workshop are wearable robotics, assistive robotic devices, feedback interfaces, human-powered augmentation, and assessment method strategies.
This workshop aims to gather researchers, developers, designers, and practitioners from various disciplines that cover the cutting edge of the HRI wearable approach community.
