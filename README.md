# SIWeaR_workshop
Emergent technologies are transforming wearable robotics, enhancing performance, usability, and user satisfaction in safe, reliable settings. This workshop explores trends in human–robot interaction for assistive devices, user experience assessment, and key research challenges, uniting experts in wearable robotics and augmentation systems.
# 1st Workshop on Setup Interfaces for Wearable Robotics: Research Challenges and Industrial Perspectives
# Workshop abstract
Adopting emergent technologies has become important in the field of wearable robotics. The integration of novel applications could simplify the task, improve performance, and increase the level of satisfaction when users interact with such disruptive technologies.
These events should occur in a safe and reliable environment.
At this point, the research meets the challenges of human interaction in wearable robotics applications.
In this workshop, we will discuss the new trends and tendencies of human-interaction systems towards assistive technologies and devices, the benefits of human-robot interaction, how to better assess the user experience, and what research challenges are faced to create a positive impact on the industry.
The topics of interest in this workshop are wearable robotics, assistive robotic devices, feedback interfaces, human-powered augmentation, and assessment method strategies.
This workshop aims to gather researchers, developers, designers, and practitioners from various disciplines that cover the cutting edge of the HRI wearable approach community.
# Call for contributions
Submission Platform:  PaperPlaza system link(https://ras.papercept.net/conferences/scripts/start.pl)

Submission Format: Extended Abstract Papers must be up to 2-4 pages (references do not count toward the page length) in IEEE Conf format with 2 columns (templates are available here). link (https://ras.papercept.net/conferences/support/support.php)

Submission deadline: ​10th of March, 2026 
Notification of acceptance: 10th of April, 2026
Final version due:  20th of April, 2026

We invite early-career researchers, roboticists, and members from different scientific communities to submit contributions. We will especially encourage women and young researchers' participation in order to support gender balance in robotics and the promotion of early-career researchers to present themselves to the community. 

Peer-reviewed (double-blind) evaluation: Submissions will be evaluated on their relevance to the workshop's themes, including innovative strategies, interfaces, and applications in wearable and haptic robotics. Submissions should demonstrate originality, scientific and technical merit, and clarity of presentation and problem statement. Priority will be given to work that provokes meaningful discussion and showcases practical applications. Non-original submissions are welcome but should properly cite the prior work. Topics of interest can be found in the workshop website.

Accepted manuscripts will be invited to present a teaser of their work to all participants of the workshop (single-track presentation). The spotlight teaser presentations will be accompanied by posters during the interactive session at the coffee break.
Selected extended abstracts and videos will be disseminated and available on the workshop website with the author's consent. Authors are naturally allowed to opt-out for any reason.

Best Workshop Paper and Video Awards:
The award for the best extended abstract will recognize the quality of the written submission and the presentation, including engagement during the poster session. 
Papers with an accompanying video will automatically enter the Best Video Award competition. The video should be a clear, concise (max. 3 minutes) demonstration of the system or experiment. It must adhere to ethical guidelines.
